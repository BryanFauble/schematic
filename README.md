## Introduction

SCHEMATIC is an acronym for _Schema Engine for Manifest Ingress and Curation_. The Python based infrastructure provides a _novel_ schema-based, data ingress ecosystem, that is meant to streamline the process of metadata annotation and validation for various data contributors.

## Installation Requirements and Pre-requisites

Following are the tools or packages that you will need to setup `schematic` for your use:

- [`pyenv`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv)
- Python 3.7.1 or higher
- [`poetry`](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry)

Note: It is recommended to use `pyenv` to be able to easily switch between Python versions. Explicit switching between environments using `poetry` is possible as well.

Make sure you are a registered and certified user on [`synapse.org`](https://www.synapse.org/), and also have all the right permissions to download credentials files in the following steps.

## Package Setup

### Clone Project Repository

Since the package isn't available on [`PyPI`](https://pypi.org/) yet, to setup the package you need to `clone` the project repoository from GitHub by running the following command:

```bash
$ git clone --single-branch --branch develop https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/schematic.git
```

### Virtual Environment Setup

You can explicitly create a virtual environment by running the following command:

```python
$ python -m venv .venv
```

To activate the `venv` virtual environment and also retreive the path to your virtual environment, run:

```bash
$ source $(poetry env info --path)/bin/activate
```

Note: If you don't want to create a `venv` virtual environment, `poetry` will create a virtual environment for you. To use `poetry`'s virtual environment, you can skip this step.

### Install Dependencies

Running the following command reads the `pyproject.toml` file from the current project, resolves the dependencies and install them:

```bash
$ poetry install
```

### Obtain Credentials File(s)

Download a copy of the `credentials.json` file stored on Synapse by running the following command:

```bash
$ synapse get syn21088684
```

Alternatively, you can also download the `schematic_service_account_creds.json` file, which uses the service account mode of authentication (_for Google services_). To download this file, run the following:

```bash
$ synapse get syn24214983
```

Note: The service account mode of authentication is still being tested and certain functionalities (for our app) which leverage Google Apps Script API are [not fully compatible with this mode](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/api/concepts). So we recommend you follow the first command in this section.

When you are using the Google credentials in the `credentials.json` file for authentication, you will be prompted to download a `token.pickle` file when you access `schematic` services (via the command line) for the first time. It will download the `token.pickle` file to the project root by default. There are configurable keys/attributes for both of these files in the `config.yml` file.

### Fill in Configuration File(s)

There are two main configuration files that need to be edited â€“ `config.yml` and `.synapseConfig`.

First, open the `.synapseConfig` file in the editor of your choice and edit the `username` and `apikey` attributes under the `[authentication]` section.

<details>
  <summary>Description of `config.yml` attributes</summary>
  
    definitions:
        synapse_config: "Path to .synapseConfig file"
        creds_path: "Path to credentials.json file"
        token_pickle: "Path to token.pickle file"
        service_acct_creds: "Path to service_account_creds.json file"

    synapse:
        master_fileview: "Fileview of project with datasets on Synapse"
        manifest_folder: "Path to folder where the manifest file should be downloaded to"
        manifest_filename: "Name of the manifest file in the Synapse project"
        api_creds: "syn23643259"

    manifest:
        title: "Name metadata manifest file"
        data_type: "Component or Data Type to be used for validation"

    model:
        input:
            location: "Path to data model JSON-LD file"
            file_type: "local"  # only this type is supported at the moment
            validation_schema: "Path to JSON Validation Schema JSON file"
            log_location: "Folder where auto-generated JSON Validation Schemas can be logged to"
        
</details>

Note: You can get your Synapse API key by: _logging into Synapse_ > _Settings_ > _Synapse API Key_ > _Show API Key_.

### Command Line Interface

The two main CLI utilities that are distributed as part of the package are:

#### Metadata Manifest Generation

To generate a metadata manifest template based on a data type that is present in your data model:

```bash
$ poetry run schematic manifest get --config /path/to/config.yml
```

Refer to the [README.md](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/schematic/tree/develop/schematic/manifest) in the sub-package for more details.

#### Metadata Manifest Validation and Submission

```bash
$ poetry run schematic model --config /path/to/config.yml submit --manifest_path /path/to/manifest.csv --dataset_id dataset_synapse_id
```

Refer to the [README.md](https://github.com/Sage-Bionetworks/schematic/tree/develop/schematic/models) in the sub-package for more details.

Note: To view a full list of all the arguments that can be supplied to the command line interfaces, add a `--help` option at the end of each of the commands.
