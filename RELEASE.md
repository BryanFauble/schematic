# Release Process

Once the code has been merged into the `develop` branch on this repo, there are two processes that need to be completed to ensure a _release_ is complete.

- You should create a GitHub [tag](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Tagging), with the appropriate version number. Typically, from `v21.06` onwards all tags are created following the Linux Ubuntu versioning convention which is the `YY.MM` format where `Y` is the year and `M` is the month of that year when that release was created.
- You should push the package to [PyPI](https://pypi.org/). Schematic is on PyPI as [schematicpy](https://pypi.org/project/schematicpy/). You can go through the following two sections for that.

## Release to Test PyPI _(optional)_

The purpose of this section is to verify that the package looks and works as intended, by viewing it on [Test PyPI](https://test.pypi.org/) and installing the test version in a separate virtual environment.

```
poetry build   # build the package
poetry config repositories.testpypi https://test.pypi.org/legacy/   # add Test PyPI as an alternate package repository
poetry publish -r testpypi   # publish the package to Test PyPI
```

Installing:

```
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/
```

## Release to PyPI _(mandatory)_

If the package looks great on Test PyPI and works well, the next step is to publish the package to PyPI:

```
poetry publish  # publish the package to PyPI
```

> You'll need to [register](https://pypi.org/account/register/) for a PyPI account before uploading packages to the package index. Similarly for [Test PyPI](https://test.pypi.org/account/register/) as well.
